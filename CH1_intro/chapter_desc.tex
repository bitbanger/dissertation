\section{Chapter Descriptions}
The remainder of this introductory chapter is Section~\ref{sec:related}, which discusses some notable related work on schema modeling and acquisition, including seminal work on the definition of schema-like knowledge (Sections~\ref{sec:schank}~and~\ref{sec:framenet}); the manual assemblage of corpora of such knowledge (Section~\ref{sec:framenet}); and its automatic acquisition from texts by both symbolic (Section~\ref{sec:ipp}) and statistical (Sections~\ref{sec:chambers}~and~\ref{sec:pichotta}) means.

Chapter~\ref{chap:el} discusses \textbf{Episodic Logic} (EL), a formal semantic representation of language used to build our schema framework. Section~\ref{sec:ulf-parsing} covers the automatic parsing of an important variant of EL, and Section~\ref{sec:parsing} discusses the conversion of that variant into the full EL form.

Chapter~\ref{chap:schemas} introduces \textbf{EL schemas}, the schematic knowledge representation around which this dissertation centers. It describes the form and semantics of EL schemas before outlining the process by which EL schemas are meant to be learned and the role of \textit{protoschemas} in that process. Finally, it outlines and discusses a process by which stories are ``matched'' to schemas, and how inferences are generated by that matching process.

Chapter~\ref{chap:learning} describes \textbf{NESL}, the neuro-episodic schema learner, a collection of projects together forming the first step toward the automatic acquisition of EL schemas from text. Section~\ref{sec:lome} describes a neural protoschema identifier. Section~\ref{sec:lss} describes \textbf{latent schema sampling}, the procedure by which NESL learns schemas without a fixed training corpus. Section~\ref{sec:schemagen} discusses the generalization of multiple similar schemas. The chapter then concludes with a discussion of NESL's contributions within the wider scope of the EL schema learning project.

Chapter~\ref{chap:eval} covers two human-judged experiments performed to evaluate the schemas learned by NESL. Section~\ref{sec:verbviz} describes the verbalization and visualization of the EL formulas within schemas to make their meaning accessible to untrained human judges. Section~\ref{sec:schema_eval} then discusses the evaluation of the quality of schema formulas as general statements about situations. Section~\ref{sec:inf_eval} then discusses the evaluation of inferences generated by learned schemas about unseen stories.
