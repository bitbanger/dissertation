Input: Jane is a policewoman.
   She dressed in a short red skirt and went to a corner.

Creating New Schema: (DressSolicitArrest ?b9 ?c2 ?s2 ?s4 ?I4 ?a9 ?c3)
?b9 is not equal to ?a9.
?b9 is a person. ?c2 is an apparel. ?b9 has ?c2. ?b9 puts on ?c2.
?s2 is a location. ?I4 is a corner. ?b9 is at ?s2.
?b9 goes from ?s2 to ?14. ?a9 is a person. ?s4 is a location.
?a9 is at ?s4. ?s9 goes from ?s4 to ?14. ?c3 is money.
?a9 needs to have sex. ?c2 is sexy.
?a9 solicits ?b9's sexual favors for ?c3. ?b9 is a police officer.
?b9 arrests ?a9 for soliciting ?b9's sexual favors for ?c3.
Having: ?b9 put on ?c2. suggests DressSolicitArrest
Having: ?a9 solicited ?b9's sexual favors for ?c3. suggestß\protect\footnotemarkß
   DressSolicitArrest
Having: ?b9 arrested ?a9 for soliciting ?b9's sexual favors for ?c3,
   suggest
DressSolicitArrest
Unknown word `?b9 entrap ?a9' refers to DressSolicitArrest
