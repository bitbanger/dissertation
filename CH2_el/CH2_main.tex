\chapter{Episodic Logic}

This chapter introduces Episodic Logic (EL), the semantic representation we use in our event schemas. EL's rich temporal semantics make it a natural fit for our schema representation, in which schemas can nest one another to represent compositions of events. Because our schemas are also meant to enable a wide variety of downstream tasks, such as the generation of natural language inferences about the situations represented by unseen stories, EL's structural similarity to the syntax of English is also appealing.

Section~\ref{sec:el} of this chapter introduces EL and discusses its key semantic features. Section~\ref{sec:ulf-parsing} describes ULF, a simplified form of EL meant to act as a stepping stone for EL semantic parsers. That section also describes efforts to parse ULF from English, including our novel, language-model based ULF parser. Finally, in Section~\ref{sec:parsing}, we discuss parsing English sentences into EL given those ULF parses.
